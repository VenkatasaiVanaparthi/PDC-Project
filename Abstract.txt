The project deals with implementation of Floyd Warshall Algorithm i.e. All Pair Shortest Path. This algorithm is implemented using parallel programming concept for faster solution. Floyd Warshall algorithm has overcome the drawbacks of Dijkstra’s and Bellman Ford Algorithm. For parallel programming, this project is implemented using open MP for which C programming is used. The purpose of developing this project is to find the shortest path between all the present nodes in a graph.
This project can be implemented for Airline Systems, Transportation services, Courier Services, Networking etc.
